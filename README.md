# Quiz game
I have made a Quiz game using HTML , CSS, JAVASCRIPT. It is very useful to gain knowledge, as the questions are very general based many can understand whats new in the world like the question "When did trump became president again?" Or we like history "when did World war 1 ended?", this way even tho the user answered the question wrong the user start to think and wonder about what might be the answer. Try It out 


*  There is list of instruction in the home page 

*  Try it...Got an answer wrong, you can search it up and retake the quiz

*  The link to the down below
